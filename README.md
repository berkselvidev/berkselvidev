# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Berk Selvi and I am a full-stack web developer specializing in backends. I am currently studying Computer Engineering at NamÄ±k Kemal University and I am also developing side projects, I really enjoy developing applications that solve real-world problems.

Since I started working in this field, I have worked in many different sectors. Over the past three years, I've built websites for my clients as a freelance developer. When I started university, I trained myself with theoretical knowledge from various sources such as MIT and Stanford. After believing that I was at a sufficient level, I started to develop complex projects.

Having a vision from long and varied work experience, I have acquired skills such as responsibility, team player, time management and problem solving. I am confident that my vision and social skills will help me in projects that I will develop alone or as a team.

**Front-End:** JavaScript, React, Redux, React-Native, HTML5, CSS3

**Back-End:** .Net Core, Python, Node.js

**Databases:** T-SQL, SQL Server, MySQL, MongoDB

**Tools:** Docker, AWS, Jira, Git, GitHub
