After believing that I was at a sufficient level, I started to develop complex projects like [full-stack social media app](https://github.com/berkslv/social-media-app) and [C multithread web server](https://github.com/berkslv/c-web-server)

Having a vision from long and varied work experience, I have acquired skills such as responsibility, team player, time management and problem solving. I am confident that my vision and soft skills will help me in projects that I will develop alone or as a team member.
